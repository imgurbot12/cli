Welcome to cli's documentation!
==================================

A highly configurable, dynamic, fast, and easy solution to managing
our command-line application. The goal is to make cli development as simple
and effective as possible for any configuration enabling the developer to
focus on function over form.

Supports Python >= 3.7 and can run asynchronously or synchronously.

This library took heavy initial inspiration by :ref:`https://github.com/urfave/cli<urfave/cli>`
so credit to them for their work as well.
